I am a dedicated and passionate Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp, specializing in Software Engineering. 
My journey in software development began with Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, which sparked my interest in IoT and the seamless integration of software and hardware. Over time, I have broadened my expertise to include DevOps, Web Development, and Machine Learning.

Driven by a commitment to continuous learning, I am always eager to explore new technologies. 
I thrive in collaborative environments where I can work closely with others and share knowledge, but I am equally comfortable taking on challenges independently.
