I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp, specializing in Software Engineering. 
With a strong foundation in programming, my journey began with Arduino and Raspberry Pi projects, igniting my passion for IoT and the integration of software and hardware systems. 
Over time, I have expanded my expertise to include DevOps, Web Development, and Machine Learning.

My early fascination with logic systems was sparked by working with Redstone in Minecraft, leading to a continuous pursuit of knowledge in the field. 
I am highly driven by the desire to learn and apply cutting-edge technologies, both in collaborative teams and independent projects. 
Skilled in problem-solving and always seeking to push the boundaries of innovation.
